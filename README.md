A place to store ideas

I mostly code in Python, specifically for machine learning applications. However, I am still relatively new to programming, so I look forward to branching out and learning new languages in the future. I plan on using Github to connect with other programmers, get feedback on projects, and build a portfolio for my potential future career!
